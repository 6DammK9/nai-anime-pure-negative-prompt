# A quick quiz for myself (CivitAI Article 4751) # 

- [Article / question list.](https://civitai.com/articles/4751/stable-diffusion-artificial-intelligence-stupid-questions)

0. If a question worth answering but never answered precisely (may not correct!), it is always a good question. [Generative artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence) was a old concept, but only rise awareness for general public after 2023. It worths to "explain a bit more" (but only a little bit). Disclaimer: I'm NOT AN ARTIST. I'm a programmer ~~and programmer has no life.~~

1. *SD is an artificial intelligence machine learning program, right?* YES. In precise, it is an [AI model](https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-model).

1.0 However, in *pop culture*, it becomes a [genre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre) or [category](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/category) of models, sharing same [model archetiture](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/model-architecture) but different in [model weight](https://machine-learning.paperspace.com/wiki/weights-and-biases). For example, [Pony Diffusion V6 XL](https://civitai.com/models/257749?modelVersionId=290640) is a model [finetuned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning_(deep_learning)) from SDXL. 

2. *So where does the machine learning happen?* [It is deep.](https://www.coursera.org/articles/data-science-vs-machine-learning). **The whole "story" is Machine Learning**:
- [Math equations on whiteboard](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01952)
- [Crawing image through the internet and not being sued](https://laion.ai/)
- [Burning GPU until CEO just leave before product release](https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/03/stability_ai_bills/)
- [Looking for the "prediction", and revise its performance](https://decrypt.co/150575/greg-rutkowski-removed-from-stable-diffusion-but-brought-back-by-ai-artists)
- All of them combined is the [lifecycle of machine learning (subset of data science)](https://www.institutedata.com/blog/5-steps-in-data-science-lifecycle/).

2.1 *Or does all the ML happen pre-release?* Ture. It is called [pretrining](https://aiml.com/what-do-you-mean-by-pretraining-finetuning-and-transfer-learning-in-the-context-of-machine-learning-or-language-modeling/). The article is about NLP, but the "SD" in the culture is the exact same path. "General images" (pretraining) > "Anime images" (larger finetuned / merged model) > "your style" (smaller finetuned model / LoRA).

2.2 *Why we need so many LoRAs?* Capability of a single model is capped within its trainined dataset (images). If your desired content is out of there (e.g. An anime character in recent anime series / someone have opt-out for the evil image dataset), you must *finetune* it. 
2.2.1 Such "small tasks" can be archieved with full model (GB in size) or LoRA (MB in size), then [obviously](https://www.quora.com/What-does-clearly-obviously-mean-in-a-mathematical-proof) public will choose to save disk size instead of [ultimate precision](https://huggingface.co/waifu-diffusion/wd40).

2.3 *Is the CivitAI (or any remote) service then always going to be better for general tasks?* [Maybe better?](https://tracxn.com/d/companies/civitai/__lPqZEx0Rc2Ctj30Dl5dV1LSbSanCD2VpFL_MkcCggDs) Sure it has hosted so many GPUs in their cloud platform. [This service is not CivitAI, but it has 256x H100s which your RTX4090 won't stand a chance.](https://blog.novelai.net/anlatan-acquires-hgx-h100-cluster-4b7a2e6a631e) [If you concern about privacy, your local machine must be better.](https://www.siliconera.com/dlsite-credit-card-usage-temporarily-suspended/)

3. *What does SD 1.5 do best and worst?* I leave it to artist. However you can compare [my SD1.5](https://civitai.com/models/155604/astolfomix) , [my SD2.1](https://civitai.com/models/255754/astolfomix-sd2) and [my SDXL](https://civitai.com/models/309514/astolfomix-xl) which are produced with almost the exact same method i.e. "average of the models I've found, and generate general images." ~~Use 1.5 until you are not satisfied.~~

3.1 *"never" list*: [It is all about bias.](https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-bias) Just look for the internet. If you are against internet trends, it won't work. [It is not a "skill issue".](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/ai-generated-images-bias-racism-sexism-stereotypes/) In the whiteboard, AI only cares what it have learnt. Many (not most) models are fine with *arbitrary prompting style.* [AI breaks your prompt into tokens and embeddings in byte form, subword scale.](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tokenizer_summary) [Pony Diffusion V6 XL](https://civitai.com/models/257749?modelVersionId=290640) earnt its own category because it made it to the exact opposite. [Maybe even further, in "hash"](https://rentry.org/ponyxl_loras_n_stuff#reverse-engineered-hashed-tokens). Note that "Hash" isvalid academically. It is just token collision.

4. *I understand that I don't know how to use it well but again, I didn't think this was going to be a fight.* Nah. SD (even the unreleased SD3) will never consistantly ouputing 5 fingers and 2 hands. It is *not even tried* in whiteboard. [That is exactly what ControlNet does](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05543), by adding [mask](https://onceuponanalgorithm.org/guide-stable-diffusion-inpaint-masked-content-options-explained/) while the computation process. 
4.1 *And this isn't gen 1, more like 20. 5 tries or so just to get him to look at the camera.* Sometimes it don't appear after 200 tries, because it can't. I have done it through my journey, single click and go to bed. Common practice is below 20, but I am daily 100 or even 200 for a [distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution) of contents. I will skip explaining why [SD](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion/blob/main/ldm/models/diffusion/ddpm.py) is a [probabilistic model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239). [You can even have legit content without any prompt.](https://github.com/6DammK9/nai-anime-pure-negative-prompt)

0. Thanks for reading to the last. Hope you are fine with the red pill.
