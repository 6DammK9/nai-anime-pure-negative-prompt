# "Enterprise MCP infrastructure" diagram #

- (251030) This chart is no longer valid since [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) appears, and eventually major software like [Open WebUI](https://docs.openwebui.com/features/mcp/), [Chainlit](https://docs.chainlit.io/advanced-features/mcp), [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/mcp) are supported.

- I think the blocked texts are easy to guess.

- The major standpoint is *it can be run in a contained private network*, which sensitive data are guarded under compilance.

- Make sure the described MCP are not related to any application. The funcitonal scope is always open.

- If you are making (agentic AI) application, **carefully fill in the context with functional requirement**.

- The LLM has its infrastructure. The dimension is different. Therefore it is not included in this diagram.
