# "Definitely not NAI" (NNAI / "Joseph's model") Pure Negative Prompt #

[Deja vu](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/102913637), [I've just been in this place before](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/101971093).

- Released by "Joseph" in [SD_CN in TG](https://t.me/StableDiffusion_CN). Original post deleted within minutes. Some "mirrors" avaliable in the channel (MD5: `d4487a0d3b482a3860ed90a481f23c26`, SHA256: `c8cbb96338802a050c1d1e0664d0ce3cd94d478d3d59ed3d4be052060f421455`).
- Obviously it is a single file... Like AnythingV3, use `925997e9.vae.pt` and rename it. *Hope that there will be compatible original VAE in the future.*
- Later release (different hash obviously) may merge here, if the discussion is short.
- From author's statement, like [Waifu Diffusion 1.4](https://gist.github.com/harubaru/313eec09026bb4090f4939d01f79a7e7), it is finetuned from original SD with some "optimaization on dataset".
- Recommended STEP count... 48? Same as NAI ~~or double~~? Notice of drastical change. 

|NNAI|NAI|AnythingV3|
|---|---|---|
|48|48|64|

- Pros: **CFG is halved to be comparable with NAI.** I don't know what it means [scientifically](https://gigazine.net/gsc_news/en/20220928-stable-diffusion-classifier-free-guidance/) or [religiously](https://decentralizedcreator.com/cfg-scale-in-stable-diffusion-and-how-to-use-it/). Visually it will be more rich and stable. **Recommended CFG is 5.5 instead of 10.5.**

|Dimension|CFG Recommended|NAI|AnythingV3|
|---|---|---|---|
|512x512|5.5|10.5|8.0|
|768x768|12.5|24.0|18.0|

- Cons: **Somewhat biased, or the "NAI premium dataset" is missing.** Once again I can see clear images with `1e-16`, comparing with NAI's `0.557`. I don't have idea on the "beautiful" `W`, *maybe it should be cloase to zero like this*, "bias" is a property / "art style", although it may be bad for "aesthetic understanding". **Some prompt adjustmnets will solve this problem gracefully.**

- Mass scale counting: In progress.
