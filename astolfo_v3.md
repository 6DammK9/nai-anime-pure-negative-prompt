# Astolfo in anything-v3 #

[Very first post but really good looking](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/102832973)

### His gender is somewhat unique here ###

```
[[male]], [[astolfo]], [[boxers]], [[underwear]], [[bulge]], [[erection]], [[calvin klein]]
```

- `1boy` not always work. You will get an additional boy instead. Also, his head will be too large, and off scale from the body.
- `solo` also doesn't work. Astolfo will become a girl easily. I can't treat it is a girly `trap` or even `shemale` / `otokonoko`. The `breasts` / `flat chest` is too obvious and cannot be ignored. 
- Use `male` instead, with `muscular`, `abs` if necessary. `male` alone already includes the muscle for a femboy.
- `male` comes from `muscular_male`, as CLIP tends to ignore `_` and decompose into words, and ignore the tag syntax because it is trained in proper English.
- `boy` alone is similar to `1boy`, but the body shape is a bit off even it was fine in NAI.
- `erection` somehow prevent the chance to have multiple human.
- `calvin klein`... A striped underwear? The yield rate is too low to confirm. As you see, half of them are girl panties...
- ~~I think the body shape is improved. Keep comparing with the NAI version.~~
