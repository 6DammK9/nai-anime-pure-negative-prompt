> There are several reasons for this:
1 - I don't understand the licenses of the models that I used and I don't want to have any problems with it
2 - for now, I don't want to fully publish the model in the form it is (v0), so it is published only in our chat
3 - I haven't even read the license

- For the "PCA TV MTD", it stands for "[Principal Component Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) with [Task Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04089) method".
