# Chapter 02: Model specific contents #

Will be slowly merged from [ch99](../ch99/readme.md).
Some BS (which is too far from ground truth) will be removed.

- Does mentioning `animevae.pt` enough to be considered / accused as "NAI Series"? [animevae_pt.md](animevae_pt.md)
- My thought of Anifusion SD, which has the "worst work comparasion" but a nice model: [anifusion_sd.md](anifusion_sd.md)
- Investigation of the real author of Anthing V3, the SOTA model of waifu universe. [any3_qqid.md](any3_qqid.md)
- Investigation of Anthing V4, a model with huge drama. [any4_qqdoc.md](any4_qqdoc.md)
- Merged "photorealistic model" ~~cosplayer diffusion~~, `basil_mix`: [4de704d8.md](4de704d8.md)
- Model history (drawn to introduce to a "realistic model" user how the model comes from): [history.md](history.md)
- Observation from #NovelAIDiffusionV3: [nai_v3_sdxl.md](nai_v3_sdxl.md)
- Observation from Pony Diffusion V6 XL: [pony_sd.md](pony_sd.md)
