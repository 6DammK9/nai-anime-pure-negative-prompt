# Model specific contents #

Will be slowly merged from [ch99](../ch99/readme.md).
Some BS (which is too far from ground truth) will be removed.

- Does mentioning `animevae.pt` enough to be considered / accused as "NAI Series"? [animevae_pt.md](animevae_pt.md)
- Investigating the real author of Anthing V3, the SOTA model of waifu universe. [any3_qqid.md](any3_qqid.md)
- Merged "photorealistic model" ~~cosplayer diffusion~~, `basil_mix`: [4de704d8.md](4de704d8.md)
- Model history (drawn to introduce to a "realistic model" user how the model comes from): [history.md](history.md)
