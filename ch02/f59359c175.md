- As seen in [Touhou discord](https://discord.com/channels/930499730843250783/1094871327833325639/1094871327833325639).

BP stands for "big pot". I don't know what V or A stands for :rofl:.

Load SD1.x first. It doesn't come with TE / VAE. ~~Why not animevae.pt? Because it is the same rofl~~

- Base model: NAI SFW
- Dataset: "Handcrafted" from everywhere you've thinked of. 1 emb 1 artist. ~~273 in total?~~ NSFW images has been removed by hand. Many artists are background focused ~~from ArtStation~~.
- Tagger: BLIP + WD tagger + "genderbender" + IDK
- How it trains: Train with tags + emb, instead of artist name. You may find it (still) looks like NAI. ~~I don't think so~~ 
- Trainer: 1024 ARB + ~~50~~ 200 EP + Latent offset + native train (no merge!) + custom gradient desecent "lazy adam" + LION 1e-6
- GPU: V100 * 8 "rbq"
- Trained prompts: "cute, loli, 1girl" ~~seems no more~~ No aesthic score has been appiled. ~~Theories omitted.~~
- Negatve prompt: ~~Treat as NAI?~~
- Original sample images (obvious not Astolfo): See the original TG post, +- 20 posts

PS: Some art theories applied (but omitted here) hence the "Big Pots". ~~I dreamt of human anatomy / PVC / Doll / ImageNet1K / ADE20K but no one is interested~~
