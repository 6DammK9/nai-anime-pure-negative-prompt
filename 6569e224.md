# "anything-v3" Pure Negative Prompt #

- **Even HF staff is joined:** [Linaqruf/anything-v3.0](https://huggingface.co/Linaqruf/anything-v3.0). Note that both of them are not related to the author. The author is not revealed outside China.

- Seems that the model has been [fine tuned in CLIP level.](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-train-your-clip-45a451dcd303). Otherwise [it is pre-trained from ground up, which is not likely.](https://wandb.ai/capecape/train_sd/reports/How-to-Train-a-Conditional-Diffusion-Model-from-Scratch--VmlldzoyNzIzNTQ1).
- It has **bias** on human (~~anime girls?~~). Objects are possible, but the emphassis ratio should be changed (NAI is 1:1 or even human 1.0: 0.8 object, this model is unknown yet).

- For the "0.102" (`24x[`) approch, follow the scale with base 8.0. Scaled with area, and not likely correlated to prompts. Maybe raised to `12x[`, if *non girl* is somewhat difficult to generate.

|768x768|18.0|

- I'm not a fan of "fragmented" art style (*impressionism*?). The AI model still need some area / color control for generating multiple subjects. But it does catch eyes.

- For "non girl" (obviously my journey with Astolfo the boy), looks like the *emphassis level* remains the same. 
- The "art styke" is even more bright (tends to use bright color, which is *popular in image segmentation / computer vision*, or *Fauvism*?).
