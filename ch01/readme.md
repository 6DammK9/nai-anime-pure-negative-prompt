# Chapter 01: Common content across models #

General discovery. Theories, procedures, practices etc. However not model specific.

- CFG-STEP scan: [cfg_step.md](./cfg_step.md)
- Prior scan: [prior.md](./prior.md)
- Any theory to compare a model? [similarity_cfg1.md](./similarity_cfg1.md)
- Prompt dystopia: [prompt.md](./prompt.md)
- My thought of Aesthetic Gradients, which is... interpolation with a confusing scoring: [ag.md](ag.md)
- My procedure for making arts: [my_procedure.md](./my_procedure.md)
- Materials on aesthetic analysis ~~and philosophy stuffs (Human value / aesthics / ambitious AI etc.)~~: [aesthetic.md](./aesthetic.md)
- Extended use cases on AI art drawings: [controlnet.md](./controlnet.md)
- "euler" is actually "momentum sampler" / "algorithm 2" : [k_euler.md](k_euler.md)
- Findings on "Hi-Res" fix: [hires_fix.md](./hires_fix.md)
- Findings on "Dynamic CFG / CFG rescale": [dynamic_cfg.md](./dynamic_cfg.md)
- Findings on "Aspect Ratio Bucketing" (moved from CH98): [arb.md](./arb.md)
- Some record about "LyCORIS": [lycoris.md](./lycoris.md)
- Findings on "FreeU": [freeu.md](freeu.md)
- Findings on CFG along with "PAG" and "CHG": [cfg_pag_chg.md](./cfg_pag_chg.md)

This session is focus on [model merging](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/developer_guides/model_merging), which an extended method on [model ensembling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning).

- Any theory about merging model? [merge.md](./merge.md)
- Maybe any theory about AutoMBW? [autombw.md](./autombw.md)
- Findings on "Git Re-Basin" in SD: [rebasin.md](./rebasin.md)
- Findings on "TIES merge" in SD: [ties.md](./ties.md)
- Findings on "Fisher Merge" in SD: [fisher.md](./fisher.md)
- Findings on "DARE Merge" in SD: [dare.md](./dare.md)
