# Materials on aesthetic analysis #

### I am really watching the whole series ###

It is not a mystery.

### My theorey ###

If you see the [Live Preview in the first 4 - 8 steps](https://github.com/cmdr2/stable-diffusion-ui#live-preview), which is already *enabled by default* in webui, you can "feel" the AI is actually tried to [draft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqrp4lS9i6M&ab_channel=%E6%9C%89%E7%82%B9%E8%89%BA%E6%80%9D%E5%93%A6) and fill in details. However, the [Gaussian latent space (Data++)](https://youtu.be/tcAZ9KvBtkg) doesn't provide *full* details to "complete the drawing" and let audiances to [recall the abstract message](https://youtu.be/tcAZ9KvBtkg?list=PLCpMvp7ftsnIbNwRnQJbDNRqO6qiN3EyH&t=2354). For example, ["bad hands"](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/ai-generated-art-hands-fingers-messed-up) shows that AI won't try to guess the missing contents, it just blurred or randomly fill in the patterns. Such hybird between [impressionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism) and [surrealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism) approach may works for most art, but it is a pity that most publics are ignoring the archievements and focusing on the weakness of such advanced [generative art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art).

Currently [some absurdly well trained model](../ch02/f59359c175.md) shows awareness on drawing sceneary along with character and obvious objects, which is close to [hyperrealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperrealism_(visual_arts)). Note what it is differnt from [Photorealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorealism) which is popular in social media. It shows "balance" between photo and hand drawn animes, meanwhile most deatils / information is preserved, and it look like it has been "self-taught" via [Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation](https://paperswithcode.com/task/unsupervised-semantic-segmentation), like what [Segment Anything](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02643) did. Maybe it is because intentionally introduced a custom tagger with sceneary focused artists.

Most general publics scarfice the diversity of the content and use intensive additional training to "fill in the missing details" (LoRA / DB with TTE), or even [intercept manually](controlnet.md), I doubt that if it is a feasible method to "contribute art". It looks like we just received another tool to "contribute drawing".

Instead, [merging models](merge.md) does provide new contents to discover (e.g. [cosplay from nowhere](../ch02/4de704d8.md)), despite lacking of academic / theoritcal support. However, current social news has alreay proven its potential.

Would art able to be *partially expressed by pure logic?* With [iterlation of knowledge graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph), indentifying [psychology and psychiatry effects as visual language](https://youtu.be/lmdtWygrvFA?si=JnEiloBs-_gvUyM_), and finally *find the sweet spot to let most people agree for some insights* via [Computational neuroscience](https://youtu.be/cufOEzoVMVA?si=VJM7O7dNIcZfNaKo)? It sounds possible, yet really, really counter intuitive.
