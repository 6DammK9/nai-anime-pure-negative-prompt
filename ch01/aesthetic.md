### I am really watching the whole series ###

- Notes in discord: [CS side](https://discord.com/channels/1027129024054575174/1077525010421383241), [VA side](https://discord.com/channels/1027129024054575174/1077834709821833216). **I strongly encourage to watch the very first video on each series.** Such "computional" "art" can be theorized. It is not a mystery.

### My theorey ###

If you see the [Live Preview in the first 4 - 8 steps](https://github.com/cmdr2/stable-diffusion-ui#live-preview), which is already *enabled by default* in webui, you can "feel" the AI is actually tried to [draft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqrp4lS9i6M&ab_channel=%E6%9C%89%E7%82%B9%E8%89%BA%E6%80%9D%E5%93%A6) and fill in details. However, the [Gaussian latent space (Data++)](https://youtu.be/tcAZ9KvBtkg) doesn't provide *full* details to "complete the drawing" and let audiances to [recall the abstract message](https://youtu.be/tcAZ9KvBtkg?list=PLCpMvp7ftsnIbNwRnQJbDNRqO6qiN3EyH&t=2354). For example, ["bad hands"](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/ai-generated-art-hands-fingers-messed-up) shows that AI won't try to guess the missing contents, it just blurred or randomly fill in the patterns. Such hybird between [impressionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism) and [surrealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism) approach may works for most art, but it is a pity that most publics are ignoring the archievements and focusing on the weakness of such advanced [generative art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art).

Currently [some absurdly well trained model](../ch02/f59359c175.md) shows awareness on drawing sceneary along with character and obvious objects, which is close to [hyperrealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperrealism_(visual_arts)). Note what it is differnt from [Photorealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorealism) which is popular in social media. It shows "balance" between photo and hand drawn animes, meanwhile most deatils / information is preserved, and it look like it has been "self-taught" via [Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation](https://paperswithcode.com/task/unsupervised-semantic-segmentation), like what [Segment Anything](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02643) did. Maybe it is because intentionally introduced a custom tagger with sceneary focused artists.

Most general publics scarfice the diversity of the content and use intensive additional training to "fill in the missing details" (LoRA / DB with TTE), or even [intercept manually](controlnet.md), I doubt that if it is a feasible method to "contribute art". It looks like we just received another tool to "contribute drawing".

Instead, [merging models](merge.md) does provide new contents to discover (e.g. [cosplay from nowhere](../ch02/4de704d8.md)), despite lacking of academic / theoritcal support. However, current social news has alreay proven its potential.

Would art able to be *partially expressed by pure logic?* With [iterlation of knowledge graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph), indentifying [psychology and psychiatry effects as visual language](https://youtu.be/lmdtWygrvFA?si=JnEiloBs-_gvUyM_), and finally *find the sweet spot to let most people agree for some insights* via [Computational neuroscience](https://youtu.be/cufOEzoVMVA?si=VJM7O7dNIcZfNaKo)? It sounds possible, yet really, really counter intuitive.

(Added on 240529): After watching some videos and articles about [Daniel Dennett](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGrRf1wD320&t=388s&ab_channel=BigThink), *I agree that many great science theory were pseudoscience before they have been rigorously criticized*, especially it is interdisciplinary for multiple subjects, and becomes an individual subject when the thoughts are being structured (may not valid!). Any findings, after criticize and experiement (may not complete!), will contribute to nice progress, *and truth will be reached eventually.* If such progress is not critical to your living, truth will be benefitical, even you are an "AI anti".

### (Extra) Unconditional image generation ###

- See [my CivitAI article](https://civitai.com/articles/5149). Will remove rant, especially ch99 if I have time.

<p>Ultimately, generative art per se is ideologically neutral. It simply is a way of creating
art and any content considerations are left to a given artist. After all, generative art is
prehistoric and precedes modernism, postmodernism, and every other “ism” on
record. Nevertheless, the postmodern condition continues to interest some artists and
critics in the realm of generative art, and it serves as a platform for extending, not
ending, that discussion.</p>

- [Better remove rants and keep it in Discord since I don't have to worry about the server now.](https://discord.com/channels/1027129024054575174/1029421705187303495/1047909834374258748) 
- tldr on 240517: [I have done House-Tree-Person Test (HTP) towards "AI" thoughout this journey.](../ch99/readme.md) I want to know AI, even I have learnt in postgrad level. If it can project human's psychological / psychiatrical status, I can do it with the same way towards "AI", then I know how it / she / he ~~Astolfo~~ perform the prediction. The "prediction" is still not fully understanded in the mathmatical / logical way, so I prefer a looser way to "peek" and make some [conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjecture).
