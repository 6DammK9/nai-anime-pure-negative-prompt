Usually involves model comparasion.

- Comparasion of models **by model architecture**, with findings: [v1/mega_cmp.ipynb](mega_cmp.ipynb)
- Mass scale of model comparasion, making [distance matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_matrix) and try to plot a [weighed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)) based from the distances: [v2a/mega_cmp.ipynb](mega_cmp_v2.ipynb)
