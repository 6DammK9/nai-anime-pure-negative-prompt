# Chapter 00: Why and what to expect #

Looks like you're really interested...

- [Red pill](red_pill.md): FAQ style of "what my research is completely different to others". But please be skeptic on me. No theory in the internet in the "waifu world" is formally (mathematically) proven yet. You may find papers in [arXiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArXiv), but sure the diffusers are aimed / benachmarked to **recover the image instead of creating art**. The justification is completely different, as the current [SOTA](https://paperswithcode.com/sota) model is [AnythingV3](https://huggingface.co/Linaqruf/anything-v3.0) which is **completely against the design of any ML concepts**.

- [About me](about_me.md): Some info to explain my non-sense. Some may call my things as "detective work", but I do involved in the events. Also why I can keep myself "in" and "involved".
