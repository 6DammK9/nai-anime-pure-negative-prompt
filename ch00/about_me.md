# About me #

## Just a random anon with no connections ##

No. I'm not going to reveal my idenity. You may able to track me down with related works / socials, but I'm not interested in any "full time positions" in community. I have a full time job + part time Msc (mainly night school) ~~in progress~~ graduated. Hire me instead.

## But I see Astolfo trolling in so many communities (and he is an admin somewhere) ##

- Yep. I stalked and social engineered for months. I also read all posts daily. 
- ~~Nope, ask the AI / ML professionals why none of them being active in the "art" communities to gather feedbacks from the "professional users", or~~ I already bought some elite stuents one by one for sharing their professional view to fight misinformation.
- *Astolfo is the male character in Danbooru having 2nd most images. AI knows him well, and it has been proven by me.*

## How about you showing pics with unreleased models / and the coincidence of ACertainty prototypes ##

This is just anons showing respects on each others. No such organization. If you try hard as me to ask about AnythingV3, you will get the same answer. I see no "group models" *but model series exists*. This is different from *some famous models*.

## I see you being inactive ##

Usually it means: There is no new models worth to explore (likely after SDXL release), or I am busy in my personal life. **I am not interested with multimedia AI, or any non drawing related AI.** I will make a new repo if I am really interested.

## Looks like LLM is kicking in. Do you Vibe research? ##

- Vibe research = [Vibe Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) + [Deep Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Research).

- **tldr: Only for quick validation.**

- I am not PhD student or professional researchers (*cough [still Msc](../ch00/about_me.md)). From amateur persecptive, formal [mathmatical proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof) will be impossible (I'm poor at algebra / calculus / statistic like LLM!). Meanwhile, many technical reports / [white papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_paper) in [engineering field](https://engineering.ubc.ca/spotlight/why-engineering/engineering-or-science-whats-best-path-for-you) does rely on [empirical evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence). ~~a.k.a experiment, or even subjective content creation!~~ Like the DDPM ("diffusion") before flow matching paper, some fact may hold true but being discovered (e.g. probablity vectors extends from vector field). It is a kind of [limitation](https://blog.wordvice.com/how-to-present-study-limitations-and-alternatives/) "I am facing right now". For example, I just rewrote [euler (method) sampler](./k_euler.md), where "default euler sampler is a modified sampler" remanins true, but the modificaiton, citation, and even the "theory", can be all non factual.

- Instead of [vibe researcing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) which just relies on LLM, I am completely inverted the process: Basic proof in general articles abundant in internet (not limited to CS, maybe physics, math, or even economy, any subjects), experimented with positive result (take months!), make sure it works consistintly in a certain conditions (no luck assumed), and finally ask LLM for and exisitng papers / articles which can be related.

- For example, **assuming not conducting rigorous (mathmatical) proof**, with *trust* in some sources in internet (arxiv with international academic conference, lecture notes from MIT, whatever), you can "estimate" with **updated LLM** (either 2024 or 2025, just after 2010) that the discussion about [flow matching](./flowmatching.md) on diffusion models are very likely true and factual. However, until I derive the entire math proof myself, or by [comptuer assisted proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_proof), it can't be absoultely certain.
