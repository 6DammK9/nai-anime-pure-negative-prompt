# About me #

## Just a random anon with no connections ##

No. I'm not going to reveal my idenity. You may able to track me down with related works / socials, but I'm not interested in any "full time positions" in community. I have a full time job + part time Msc (mainly night school) in progress. Hire me instead.

## But I see Astolfo trolling in so many communities (and he is an admin somewhere) ##

- Yep. I stalked and social engineered for months. I also read all posts daily. 
- Nope, ask the AI / ML professionals why none of them being active in the "art" communities to gather feedbacks from the "professional users", or sharing their professional view to fight misinformation.

## How about you showing pics with unreleased models / and the coincidence of ACertainty prototypes ##

This is just anons showing respects on each others. No such organization. If you try hard as me to ask about AnythingV3, you will get the same answer. I see no "group models". This is different from *some famous models*.
