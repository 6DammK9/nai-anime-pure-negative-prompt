- Somehow the bias only does mild effect on prompts / art styles. The streadgy for NAI remains the same, with the negative prompt streangth minimized.
- (Faith) For biased model, use `male` instead of `boy`, otherwise the shape is too girly.
- `bulge` is ineffective. Believed that `race queen` limited the "featrue".
- Yield is similar to NAI. Even the face is similar to NAI. But when you **paying attention on his face**, there is a slight difference (<10%): 
1. The pupil is larger
2. Facial expression (smug) is wider
3. Hair style a little bit asymmetric (I like this most: VAE tends to make it symmetric)
