I did it in hurry. Only broken Chinese / English which is almost gibberish to oridinary people.

- "euler" is actually "momentum sampler" / "algorithm 2" : [k_euler.md](k_euler.md)
- My thought of "CFG coefficient", which shared a loosen similarity to regularization / hyperparameter: [cfg.md](cfg.md)
- My thought of Anifusion SD, which has the "worst work comparasion" but a nice model: [anifusion_sd.md](anifusion_sd.md)
- My thought of Aesthetic Gradients, which is... interpolation with a confusing scoring: [ag.md](ag.md)
- When lengthy prompt works: [77_token.md](77_token.md) 
- Philosophy stuffs (Human value / aesthics / ambitious AI etc. mostly reading materials): [phil.md](phil.md)
- Effectiveness of "Aspect Ratio Bucketing": [arb.md](arb.md)
- A SoK on vid2vid(and seperate from text2vid): [vid2vid.md](vid2vid.md)

These are created for... surviving in internet.
