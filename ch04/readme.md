# Chapter 04: A (very dumb) batch script for multiple WebUI instances #

Self explained. Written for ex-mining rig if I can get one of them eventually.

- Place all `*.bat` to the WebUI directory.
- Modify the scripts if necessary. *It is tested with 2x RTX 3070 for 1024x576 hires 2x*.
- In case you don't have idea: `COMMANDLINE_ARGS`, `CARD_COUNT`, `DELAY`.
- Double click `webui-user-x.bat` to start.
- Try install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and manually create Terminals to run all of them. At least you won't be blocked by focusing in Window's UI.
