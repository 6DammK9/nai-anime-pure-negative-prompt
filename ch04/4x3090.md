# Small 4x RTX 3090 AI Training rig #

tldr: This is a dedicated setup to finetune [Stable Diffusion XL](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0). [It barely runs with compromised setting.](https://github.com/6DammK9/nai-anime-pure-negative-prompt/blob/main/ch06/manjaro.md) *It is small in size, around mid tower ATX, insead of a mining rig.*

## How the parts are gathered ##

- Mostly from Carousell / DCFever and offline deals. The listed parts are stripped from ebay / **goofish** (xianyu) for "proof of existance".

## Part List with Details ##

- CPU: [Intel i9-7960X](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/126697/intel-core-i97960x-xseries-processor-22m-cache-up-to-4-20-ghz/specifications.html). It has **44 PCIe lanes** (comparing to i7's 28) to support 4 GPUs and a U.2 drive.

- Motherboard: [EVGA X299 Dark](https://www.evga.com/articles/archive/01168/evga-x299-dark/default.asp). Besides 4 GPU slots, it **has beefy external 6-pin PCIe power**. The blower RTX 3090s will pull 50W from the PCIe slot, without external PCIe slot power, such as [Supermicro C9X299-RPGF](https://www.supermicro.com/zh_tw/products/motherboard/C9X299-RPGF) (it has on board display!), the power rail voltage drop to as low as 10.8V, causing PSU trip. With the external PCIe power, it has restored to 11.6V.

- RAM1: [Kingston FURY Beast DDR4 RGB 3200MT/s 64GB kit](https://www.kingston.com/tw/memory/gaming/kingston-fury-beast-ddr4-rgb-memory?speed=3200mt%2Fs&total%20(kit)%20capacity=64gb&kit=kit%20of%202&dram%20density=16gbit). A pair of 32GB stick from my current Miku RGB build.

- RAM2: A pair of HEORIADY 32G sticks. It is instable in general, using a special stacked die ["d9xqm"](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Micron/MT40A4G8BAF-062EB?qs=P1JMDcb91o6pDgDNMut7pA%3D%3D&srsltid=AfmBOop5SXC6-B3OslDFknhijYVqJ_a7T0lovDba9PVGykvar0MGeUJ2) from Micron. **It is a rare single side 32GB UDIMM.**

- GPU1: [Zotac RTX 3090 OEM Blower "ZT-A30900A-10B"](https://www.goofish.com/item?id=826430567450). Originally released from goofish / xianyu, but I eventually obtained from a local deal. Condition was "looks good but overheat". Thermal paste / thermal pad refresh refresh solved the problem.

- GPU2: [Colourful RTX 3090 OEM Blower](https://www.goofish.com/item?id=850461077002). Obtained from a local deal. Close to brandnew. Works fine. However the factory BIOS mod made the fan spins around 60% when idle, which is loud. Others are 30%.

- GPU3: [Manli RTX 3090 OEM Blower](https://www.goofish.com/item?&id=877004948113). Same deal with the Zotac, even the condition / PCB / BIOS mod are identical. Thermal paste / thermal pad refresh refresh solved the problem. *Parent company of both brand is PCPartner?*

- GPU4: [Gigabyte RTX 3090 Gaming OC](https://www.gigabyte.com/Graphics-Card/GV-N3090GAMING-OC-24GD#kf), but modified with 3080 Turbo heatsink and become [Gigabyte 3090 Turbo](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/gigabyte-rtx-3090-turbo.b8061). It took me many hours to mod: Most capacitors are needed to swap, meanwhile many connectors are needed to be removed, even the BIOS switch needed to be shaved, and finally the BIOS swap.

- SSD1: [Intel / Solidigm DC P4510 3.84TB](https://www.amazon.com/Intel-SSDPE2KX040T8-SSDPE2KX040T801-Lenovo-Supermicro/dp/B0BCFVBSD8). Storing dataset and training results.

- SSD2: [Samsung PM863a 1.92TB](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-PM863a-Enterprise-Internal-MZ-7LM1T9N/dp/B01MA34RLJ?th=1). Storing WebUI, codes, and logs. Notice that it is SATA instead of U.2. My SSD may be fauly: It drops connection (may not offine) after hours of idle.

- SSD3: [Plextor M6 Pro 128GB](https://www.techpowerup.com/203842/plextor-m6-pro-with-plexturbo-now-available-worldwide). *Just a random SSD for Linux OS.* Storing training code, IDE and some notes.

- PSU: ["JL2000PG" 2000W mining PSU](https://www.tradera.com/item/341048/659986832/jl2000pg-2000w-nataggregat). Claimed "93% efficiency", comes with 8x 8+8pin powercords. I bought it brand new. I replaced the noisy fan with [Corsiar NR135L](https://www.amazon.com/NR135L-13-5cm-Cooling-Chassis-Cooler/dp/B097ZVMDKC). The PSU runs at 61C with 1200W loading (viewed via [thermal camera](https://thermal.uni-trend.com/product/uti120b/)).

- Frame: *Unbranded EATX aluminum open benchtable.* I searched in [Taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=700709734473) for many pages, for 4 card support, which is no more common. Since it is sheet based instead of column based, it is still more expensive than a oridinary PC case. Common choice will be mining rig with server board, but I don't have space.
