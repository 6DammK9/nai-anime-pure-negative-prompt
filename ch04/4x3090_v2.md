# Small 4x RTX 3090 AI Training rig (v2.0) #

tldr: This is a dedicated setup to finetune [Stable Diffusion XL](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0). [It barely runs with compromised setting.](https://github.com/6DammK9/nai-anime-pure-negative-prompt/blob/main/ch06/manjaro/readme.md) *It is small in size, around mid tower ATX, insead of a mining rig.* **v3 is being explored.** CPU internal (CCD) latency is high in EPYC, causing stalling when performing NCCL `all_reduce`.

## How the parts are gathered ##

- Major parts from Taobao / Aliexpress. Others majorly from Carousell / DCFever and offline deals. The listed parts are stripped from ebay / amazon for "proof of existance".

## Part List with Details ##

- CPU: [AMD EPYC 7282](https://www.techpowerup.com/cpu-specs/epyc-7282.c2255). One of the cheapest CPU in 7002 / 7003 series. Low core count but moderate-high frequency. Followed [official "low latency" guide](https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/epyc-technical-docs/white-papers/58649_amd-epyc-tg-low-latency.pdf) for maximum training speed (still slower than X299).

- Motherboard: [TYAN S8030](https://www.mitaccomputing.com/Motherboards_S8030_S8030GM2NE_CN~Spec). Picked S8030GM2NE / "OOY" version due to the lower cost. See [chiphell post](https://www.chiphell.com/thread-2496038-1-1.html) for detailed review. **Dedicated PCIE power supply** and **more than 64 PCIE 4.0 lanes** is the major reason picking this board. The PCIE lane signal interference is considered the curpit of the stalling training speed.

- RAM: **8x DDR4 2933Mhz 2Rx4 64GB RDIMM.** 512GB in total. *A lot more expensive than the 2400Mhz 4Rx4 64GB LRDIMM.* Brand / parts number are mixed: 2x [Samsumg M393A8G40MB2-CVF](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/dram/module/rdimm/m393a8g40mb2-cvf/). 4x [Hynix HMAA8GR7AJR4N-WM](https://www.amazon.com/-/zh_TW/Hynix-HMAA8GR7AJR4N-WM-DDR4-2933-RDIMM-MEM-DR464L-HL02-ER29/dp/B084SSVDTM), 2x [Micron 36ASF8G72PZ-2G9E1](https://www.micron.com/products/memory/dram-modules/rdimm/part-catalog/part-detail/mta36asf8g72pz-2G9E1). Training process requires at least 288GB to operate, with *memory leaking* and *data workers* included, it consumes up to 480GB of memory. Swap files can be used, but there will be performance impact.

- GPU1: [Gigabyte RTX 3090 Gaming OC](https://www.gigabyte.com/Graphics-Card/GV-N3090GAMING-OC-24GD#kf), but modified with 3080 Turbo heatsink and become [Gigabyte 3090 Turbo](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/gigabyte-rtx-3090-turbo.b8061). It took me many hours to mod: Most capacitors are needed to swap, meanwhile many connectors are needed to be removed, even the BIOS switch needed to be shaved, and finally the BIOS swap.

- GPU2: [Colourful RTX 3090 OEM Blower](https://www.goofish.com/item?id=850461077002). Obtained from a local deal. Close to brandnew. Works fine. However the factory BIOS mod made the fan spins around 60% when idle, which is loud. Others are 30%.

- GPU3: [Zotac RTX 3090 OEM Blower "ZT-A30900A-10B"](https://www.goofish.com/item?id=826430567450). Originally released from goofish / xianyu, but I eventually obtained from a local deal. Condition was "looks good but overheat". Thermal paste / thermal pad refresh refresh solved the problem.

- GPU4: [Manli RTX 3090 OEM Blower](https://www.goofish.com/item?&id=877004948113). Same deal with the Zotac, even the condition / PCB / BIOS mod are identical. Thermal paste / thermal pad refresh refresh solved the problem. *Parent company of both brand is PCPartner?*

- SSD1: [Intel / Solidigm DC P4510 3.84TB](https://www.amazon.com/Intel-SSDPE2KX040T8-SSDPE2KX040T801-Lenovo-Supermicro/dp/B0BCFVBSD8). Storing dataset and training results.

- SSD2: [Samsung PM863a 1.92TB](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-PM863a-Enterprise-Internal-MZ-7LM1T9N/dp/B01MA34RLJ?th=1). Storing WebUI, codes, and logs. Notice that it is SATA instead of U.2. My SSD may be fauly: It drops connection (may not offine) after hours of idle.

- SSD3: [Toshiba 960GB OEM SATA SSD "THNSN8960PCSE"](https://www.ebay.com/itm/265189471181). Obtained from a nice deal. OS / codes consumes less than 64GB, and I assigned 512GB for swap file, which can persist for a longer term of memory leaking.

- SSD4 (disabled): 2x [WD SN750 2TB](https://www.amazon.com/Black-SN750-Internal-Gaming-Heatsink/dp/B07MLVK8K5) with generic M.2 to 2.5" U.2 case. It was made for giant 4TB swap file, but I found that the PCIE signal interference stalled training speed even they are inactive.

- PSU: [Great Wall 2000W full modular PSU "GW-EPS2000BL"](https://www.amazon.com/GW-EPS2000BL-2000W-Gaming-Power-Supply/dp/B0DHSYVMB7). "Premium mining PSU" replacing the blown PSU. 10x 12V rails so there is no more single rail overloading. 

- Frame: *Unbranded EATX aluminum open benchtable.* I searched in [Taobao](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=700709734473) for many pages, for 4 card support, which is no more common. Since it is sheet based instead of column based, it is still more expensive than a oridinary PC case. Common choice will be mining rig with server board, but I don't have space.
